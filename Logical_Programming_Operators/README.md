task3.py

● Create a new Python file in this folder called task3.py.
● Design a program that determines the award a person competing in a
triathlon will receive.
● Your program should read in the times (in minutes) for all three events of a
triathlon, namely swimming, cycling, and running, and then calculate and
display the total time taken to complete the triathlon.
● The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to
complete the triathlon. The qualifying time for awards is 100 minutes.
Display the award that the participant will receive based on the following
criteria:

              Total time                |               Award
____________________________________________________________________			  
Within qualifying time                  |  Provincial Colours
Within 5 minutes of qualifying time     |  Provincial Half Colours
Within 10 minutes of qualifying time    |  Provincial Scroll
More than 10 minutes of qualifying time |  No award
