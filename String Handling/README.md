● Create a program called alternative.py that reads in a string and makes
each alternate character an UPPERCASE character and each other
alternate character a lowercase character (e.g, the string “Hello World”
would become “HeLlO WoRlD”).
● Now, try starting with the same string but making each alternative word
lower and upper case (e.g. the string: “I am learning to code” would
become “i AM learning TO code”). Using the split and join functions will
help you here.
