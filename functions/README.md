● Create a Python file called holiday.py in your folder. Your task will be to
calculate a user’s holiday cost including the plane cost, hotel cost, and
car rental cost.
● First, get the following user inputs:
○ city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (You can create some
options for them. Remember: Each city will have different flight
costs.)
○ num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel
○ rental_days: The number of days that they will be hiring a car for.
● Next, create the following four functions:
● hotel_cost: This function will take the num_nights as an argument,
and return a total cost for the hotel stay (You can choose the price
per night charged at the hotel).
● plane_cost: This function will take the city_flight as an argument
and return a cost for the flight (hint: use if/else if statements in the
function to retrieve a price based on the chosen city).
● car_rental: This function will take the rental_days as an argument
and return the total cost of the car rental (you can choose the daily
rental cost.)
● holiday_cost: This function will take the three arguments
hotel_cost, plane_cost, car_rental. Using these three
arguments, you can call all three of the above functions with
respective arguments and finally return a total cost for your
holiday.
● Print out all the details about the holiday in a readable way!
● Try using your program with different combinations of input to show its
compatibility with different options
