#a variety of named and numeric entities, including companies, locations, organizations and products

# i looked up for entity 'GPE' and "PERSON"
 #GPE = 'Countries, cities, states'
 #"PERSON" = 'People, including fictional'

#Question: Did the entity make sense in terms of the word associated with it?
#ans: yes they make sense :)
