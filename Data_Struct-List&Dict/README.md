cafe.py

Follow these steps:
● Imagine you are running a cafe. Create a new Python file in your folder
called cafe.py.
● Create a list called menu, which should contain at least 4 items in the cafe.
● Next, create a dictionary called stock, which should contain the stock
value for each item on your menu.
● Create another dictionary called price, which should contain the prices for
each item on your menu.
● Next, calculate the total_stock worth in the cafe. You will need to
remember to loop through the appropriate dictionaries and lists to do
this.
Tip: When you loop through the menu list, the ‘items’ can be set as keys
to access the corresponding ‘stock’ and ‘price’ values. Each ‘item_value’ is
calculated by multiplying stock value by the price value. For example:
item_value = (stock[items] * price[items])
● Finally, print out the result of your calculation.
